# 💡 Project Idea: Stair Climbing Robot

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to develop a robot capable of climbing stairs autonomously, solving the problem of limited mobility in traditional wheeled robots. The robot is intended for use in environments such as rescue missions, smart homes, and industrial settings where stair navigation is essential.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a lightweight and compact robot that can handle staircases of variable heights.
- Achieve autonomous vertical movement using motors and a rack & pinion mechanism.
- Develop code using ESP32 to control motor coordination for elevation and balance.
- Create a low-cost and easily replicable solution for real-world use.

## 📌 Why This Project?
Traditional wheeled robots:
- Cannot navigate stairs
- Fail on uneven or stepped terrains
- Are limited to flat, smooth surfaces

We wanted to address these challenges using simple mechanical concepts like pulleys, lead screws, and gear motors combined with microcontroller logic.

## 🧠 Concept Development
We were inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/sHyekTDxaH8?si=n2f1cvXuMfX4rgW8), which showed a stair-climbing concept using mechanical lifts. We adapted and modified the design for real-world feasibility with available parts like:
- BO motors
- L298N driver
- ESP32 (for smarter control)
- Rack and pinion + pulley systems

---

## 🏁 Current Status
- ✅ Hardware structure prototyped
- 🛠️ Software under development
- 📷 Media being collected

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations
- Add object/stair detection sensors
- Enable remote control via app or voice
- Train AI model to adapt to varying stair types
